In this Project I leveled up my code skills in react.
Oriented by the current React course that I'm studing, we built together an app that basicaly reaches the github accounts showing its repositories retriving the data from the api.github.

In this Project I learned also the usage of react hooks, react routes dom, the package styled-components for styling components using JS.

It was a hude application and still complex for my beginning stage, but helped me a lot to understand better the infinit possibilities that react offers.
